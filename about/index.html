Hello my name is Suryanarayanamurthy, Please call me Surya.

I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science in <li><a href="http://www.hochschule-heidelberg.de/en/schools/school-of-informatics/">Hochschule Heidelberg School of Informatics</a></li>.
I have about 4 years of industrial experience as a software developer, in multiple domains and technologies, I’m mainly experienced in developing and maintaining desktop applications in C# language, Hence I’m skilled in Object Oriented Concepts ; you can find further details about its whereabouts in my attached <a href="/CV">resume</a>.
I’m very much interested to make a switch from my current carrier path to the domain of gaming and animation.

I do understand that I do not have experience relevant for Gaming and animations. Hence I’m willing to work as a post masters Intern for working and learning different aspects of Gaming.
From my side I’m consistently self-learning different aspects of modelling and animation using “Blender Tool”, and learning game development using Unity-5.
You can have a look at what I have learnt in <a href="/Animation">Animation</a> and <a href="/Gaming">Gaming</a>.

I’m fairly confident that, with the help of my knowledge in the field of computer science, and my passion towards this domain, I will be a useful resource in your company.
Please do consider my application; I’m eagerly waiting for a personal interview with you.

Thanks & Regards
Surya.
