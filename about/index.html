Hello my name is Suryanarayanamurthy, Please call me Surya <i class="fa fa-sun-o"></i>. <br><br>

I am currently doing my <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Masters in Computer Science in <a href="http://www.hochschule-heidelberg.de/en/schools/school-of-informatics/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-university"></i>Hochschule Heidelberg School of Informatics</a>.<br>
I have about 4 years of industrial experience as a software developer, in multiple domains and technologies, I’m mainly experienced in developing and maintaining desktop applications in C# language, Hence I’m skilled in Object Oriented Concepts ; you can find further details about its whereabouts in my<br> attached 
<a href="../resources/Suryanarayanamurthy_May2015-EN.pdf" class="download"  target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i>resume</a>.<br><br>
I’m very much interested to make a switch from my current carrier path to the domain of gaming and animation.<br>

I do understand that I do not have industrial experience relevant for Gaming and animations <i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i>.
 Hence I’m willing to work as a post masters Intern for working and learning different aspects of Gaming.
From my side I’m consistently self-learning different aspects of modelling and animation using “Blender Tool”, and learning game development using Unity-5.
You can have a look at what I have learnt in <a href="/Games"><i class="fa fa-gamepad"></i>Gaming</a>.<br><br>

I’m fairly confident that, with the help of my knowledge in the field of computer science, and my passion towards this domain, I will be a useful resource in your company.<br>
Please do consider my application; <br> I’m eagerly waiting for a personal interview with you.<br> 
<br>

Thanks & Regards<br>
Surya.
