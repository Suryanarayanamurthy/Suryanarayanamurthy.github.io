Hello my name is Suryanarayanamurthy, Please call me Surya <i class="fa fa-sun-o"></i>. <br><br>

I am currently doing my <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Masters in Computer Science in <a href="http://www.hochschule-heidelberg.de/en/schools/school-of-informatics/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-university"></i>Hochschule Heidelberg School of Informatics</a>.<br>
I have about 4 years of industrial experience as a software developer, in multiple domains and technologies, I’m mainly experienced in developing and maintaining desktop applications in C# language, Hence I’m skilled in Object Oriented Concepts ; you can find further details about its whereabouts in my<br> attached

I am very passionate about problem solving.

and learning game development using Unity-5 and Unreal Engine 4.
